# Avatar Feature Implementation

This implementation adds comprehensive avatar support to the ticket management system, allowing Agents, Admins, and Customers to have personalized avatar displays.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Custom Avatar Upload for System Users
- **Upload Interface**: Users can upload custom avatar images through a dialog in the header dropdown
- **File Validation**: Only image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) up to 5MB are allowed
- **File Management**: Old avatars are automatically deleted when new ones are uploaded
- **Remove Functionality**: Users can remove their avatars to fall back to initials

### 2. Avatar Components
- **UserAvatar**: For system users (admins, supporters) with custom avatar support
- **CustomerAvatar**: For external customers using initials from name/email

### 3. Intelligent Fallbacks
- **System Users**: Falls back to initials when no custom avatar is uploaded
- **Customers**: Always uses initials generated from name or email
- **Multiple Sizes**: Supports sm, md, lg, xl sizes for different contexts

### 4. Complete UI Integration
All user icons have been replaced with proper avatar components:
- Header dropdown with avatar upload option
- User management list
- Ticket comments (both internal and external)
- Ticket participants
- User assignment dropdowns
- Create ticket dialog

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  avatarUrl String? // URL to user's avatar image
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/users/avatar` - Upload new avatar
- `DELETE /api/users/avatar` - Remove current avatar

### Components Created
- `UserAvatar` - For system users with avatar upload support
- `CustomerAvatar` - For external customers with initials
- `AvatarUploadDialog` - Upload interface component

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Initials Generation**: Intelligently extracts initials from names and emails
2. **File Storage**: Avatars stored in `/public/uploads/avatars/` with unique filenames
3. **Session Integration**: Avatar URLs included in NextAuth sessions
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Usage Examples

### System User Avatar
```tsx
<UserAvatar 
  user={{
    name: "John Smith",
    email: "john@company.com", 
    avatarUrl: "/uploads/avatars/user123.jpg"
  }}
  size="lg"
/>
```

### Customer Avatar
```tsx
<CustomerAvatar 
  name="Jane Customer"
  email="jane@external.com"
  size="md"
/>
```

### Avatar Upload
```tsx
<AvatarUploadDialog
  user={currentUser}
  trigger={<Button>Change Avatar</Button>}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Users can upload custom avatars for better identification
2. **Consistency**: All user representations now use avatar components
3. **Professional Appearance**: Improved visual design with proper user identification
4. **Customer Experience**: External customers have distinctive avatar representations
5. **Scalability**: Avatar system works across all user interactions in the system
