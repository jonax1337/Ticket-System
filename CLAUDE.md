# CLAUDE.md

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this ticket management system codebase.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes Prisma generate)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npx prisma generate` - Generate Prisma client after schema changes
- `npx prisma db push` - Push schema changes to database
- `npx prisma migrate dev` - Create and apply migration
- `npx prisma migrate deploy` - Apply migrations to database
- `npx prisma studio` - Open database browser

**Note**: User prefers to run `npm run build` and `npm run dev` via PowerShell on their system. Claude should fix build errors but not execute builds.

## Database Migration Notes

When schema changes are made:
1. Always run `npx prisma migrate dev` in development to create and apply migrations
2. Use `npx prisma migrate deploy` to apply migrations without creating new ones
3. If database sync issues occur, check that all migrations are properly applied
4. For schema synchronization issues, see `DATABASE_FIX.md` for troubleshooting steps

## Email Template System - FULLY WORKING âœ…

### Recent Major Fixes (August 2025)
The email template system was completely rebuilt and is now fully functional:

#### ðŸ”§ Variable Replacement System Fixed
- **Problem**: Variables like `{{customerName}}`, `{{ticketNumber}}` weren't being replaced in customer emails
- **Root Cause**: Race condition where `replaceTemplateVariables()` removed ALL `{{...}}` placeholders before sections and action buttons could be processed
- **Solution**: Added `preservePlaceholders` parameter to `replaceTemplateVariables()` to protect `{{sections}}` and `{{actionButton}}`
- **Result**: All variables now properly replaced in both preview and actual emails

#### ðŸ”§ Mock Data for Previews Enhanced  
- **Problem**: Preview showed generic/empty data
- **Solution**: Template-specific realistic mock data for each email type:
  - `ticket_created`: Complete ticket information with realistic details
  - `comment_added`: Full comment content with HTML formatting and author details
  - `status_changed`: Previous/new status with actor information and timestamps
  - `participant_added`: Participant details with type and context
  - `automation_warning`: Warning context with inactivity timeframes
  - `automation_closed`: Closure information with help options
- **Result**: Previews now show exactly how emails will look to customers

#### ðŸ”§ Section Rendering Completely Fixed
- **Problem**: Email sections were empty in both preview and actual emails  
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed variable replacement order in `renderSections()`
  - Added conditional content support (`{{#variable}}...{{/variable}}`)
  - Ensured sections are processed AFTER template variables but BEFORE cleanup
- **Result**: All ticket details, comments, and information properly displayed

#### ðŸ”§ Action Buttons Removed (No Self-Service Portal)
- **Problem**: Emails showed broken `[{{ticketUrl}}]View Ticket` buttons
- **Solution**: 
  - `generateActionButton()` always returns `null`
  - Database action buttons ignored (`actionButton = null` in all code paths)
  - No self-service portal available, so no buttons needed
- **Result**: Clean emails without broken buttons

#### ðŸ”§ Support Email Uses Real Outbound Address
- **Problem**: Footer showed "support@example.com" 
- **Solution**: `getSystemDefaults()` now queries email configuration and uses outbound account email
- **Result**: Footer shows real support email address

#### ðŸ”§ Header Title Hiding Fixed
- **Problem**: "Support Dashboard" still appeared in header even when hidden
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `renderEmailHeaderTitle()` function
  - Changed base template from `<h1>{{headerTitle}}</h1>` to `{{emailHeaderTitle}}`
  - Header title now respects `emailHideAppName` setting
- **Result**: Header completely clean when hiding is enabled

### Email Template Architecture

#### Core Files
- `src/lib/email-template-service.ts` - Main template processing and variable replacement
- `src/lib/email-base-template.ts` - Base HTML template and section generation  
- `src/app/api/admin/email-templates/base/preview/route.ts` - Preview API with mock data

#### Template Processing Flow
1. **Load Configuration**: Get email type config from database or fallback to hardcoded
2. **Generate Content**: Create sections and process action buttons (disabled)
3. **System Settings**: Load logo, app name visibility, and outbound email settings
4. **Variable Processing**: 
   - First pass: Replace variables in template strings themselves
   - Second pass: Replace all template placeholders (preserving sections/actionButton)
   - Third pass: Process sections with full variable replacement
   - Fourth pass: Insert processed sections and buttons into template
5. **Final Output**: Clean HTML with all variables properly replaced

#### Variable Replacement System
```typescript
// NEW: Preserve specific placeholders during replacement
replaceTemplateVariables(html, variables, ['sections', 'actionButton'])

// Conditional content support
{{#statusChangeReason}}<p><strong>Reason:</strong> {{statusChangeReason}}</p>{{/statusChangeReason}}
```

#### Email Types & Sections
Each email type has specific sections with relevant information:
- **ticket_created**: Ticket details (number, subject, status, priority, created date)
- **comment_added**: Comment content + ticket details
- **status_changed**: Status change info + ticket details  
- **participant_added**: Participation details + ticket details
- **automation_warning**: Warning message + action instructions + ticket details
- **automation_closed**: Closure info + ticket summary + help options

### Settings Integration
- `emailHideAppName`: Hides both app name and header title in emails
- `emailShowLogo`: Controls logo display in email header
- `emailHideSlogan`: Controls slogan display  
- Outbound email configuration: Automatically used for support contact in footer

### Testing Email Templates
- Preview API: `/api/admin/email-templates/base/preview`
- All templates use unified system with realistic mock data
- Variables properly replaced in both preview and actual email sending
- No action buttons (self-service portal disabled)
